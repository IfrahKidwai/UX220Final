  <h1>Comparison of PNG and JPG Images</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Ways that PNGs are superior to JPGs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lossless Quality: PNG maintains image quality without compression artifacts, making it suitable for graphics where precision is crucial.</li>
      <li>Transparency: PNG supports alpha channel transparency, allowing for seamless integration with different backgrounds, unlike JPEG.</li>
      <li>Text and Line Art Clarity: PNG preserves sharp edges and text clarity, making it preferable for images with text or line-based graphics compared to JPEG.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ways that PNGs are inferior to JPGs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>File Size: JPGs have smaller file sizes due to more aggressive compression, making them ideal for web applications and environments where space is a concern.</li>
      <li>Photographic Content: JPG is lossy, sacrificing some quality for smaller sizes, but this is often imperceptible in photographs and images with smooth gradients. PNG, being lossless, retains all data, leading to larger file sizes for certain images.</li>
    </ul>
